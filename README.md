### *** STEP 1 ***
First, we will want to import four csv files that contain all of the zip codes in AL, MS, GA, and SC. 

```ruby AL_ZIP_CODES = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipHarvey20/Network-Optimization---K-Means/master/zip_codes/AL_ZIPCODES.csv') ``` 
```GA_ZIP_CODES = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipHarvey20/Network-Optimization---K-Means/master/zip_codes/GA_ZIPCODES.csv') ```
``` MS_ZIP_CODES = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipHarvey20/Network-Optimization---K-Means/master/zip_codes/MS_ZIPCODES.csv') ```
``` SC_ZIP_CODES = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipHarvey20/Network-Optimization---K-Means/master/zip_codes/SC_ZIPCODES.csv') ```
``` us_coordinate_lookup = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipHarvey20/Network-Optimization---K-Means/master/USZIPCodes202204.csv') ```
